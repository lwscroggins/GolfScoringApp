Golf Scoring App
================

This is my second try at building a web app that will allow users to throw away those nasty little cards and pencils they get at a golf course.

When completed:

1. The user should be able to create a new account with a password.
2. The user should be able to select a golf course in his/her general geographic location.
3. The app should load the holes on the course with their par values.
4. The user should be able to fill in their score.
5. The user should be able to submit their scores by pressing a submit button for each hole or swiping away the score container.
6. The app, at the end of the game, should summarize the game by showing the holes played, the par and the over/under par.
7. The app should save the game to the user's account.
8. The user should be able to send an email to their email address and/or the golf pro with the summary.
9. When the user plays the same course, they should be able to compare scores from their current game to their previous games on the same course.
